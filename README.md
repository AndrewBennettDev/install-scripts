# Install Scripts

### Description
This (or these) repo is for install scripts to run on new machines and install the basic things I like to have. Currently it
includes basic programs (editors, Slack, preferred browsers, etc) and a few languages I use regularly. Eventually I hope this
will be enough to setup a new workstation with one script, regardless of OS.

### Usage
This has not been tested as of this commit, do not try to run it! I have no idea what will happen and I claim no responsibility
for bricking your beautiful new MacBook.
